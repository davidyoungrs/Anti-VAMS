## 1. Introduction and Scope
TheValve.pro ("we," "us," or "our") respects the privacy of our users ("you," "your," or "Customer"). This Terms & Privacy Notice describes how we collect, use, and share personal data when you use our software applications ("The Software").

**Governing Law**: These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the **law of Scotland**. The courts of Scotland shall have exclusive jurisdiction.

## 2. Information We Collect
We collect information in the following ways:

### 2.1 Information You Provide to Us
-   **Customer Data**: When you create valve records, you input data such as names, client details, and technical specifications ("Customer Data"). In our "Local First" architecture, this data primarily resides on your local device.
-   **User Account Info**: If you register for Cloud Sync (Supabase), we collect your email address and authentication credentials.
-   **Support Inquiries**: content of messages you send to us for support.

### 2.2 Passive Collection
-   **Usage Data**: We may collect anonymous telemetry (e.g., features used, error logs) to improve system stability.
-   **Local Storage/Cookies**: We use browser LocalStorage and necessary cookies to maintain your session and store your work offline.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We process your information for limited purposes:
1.  **To Provide the Services**: To authenticate you, sync your data (if cloud enabled), and generate PDF reports.
2.  **To Secure the Services**: To verify accounts and protect against unauthorized access.
3.  **Legitimate Interests**: To analyze usage trends and develop new features (e.g., identifying which valve types are most frequently tested).

## 4. Data Retention & Security
-   **Retention**: We retain Cloud Sync data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide Services. Local data remains on your device until you clear your browser cache.
-   **Security**: We implement industry-standard encryption for data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest in our cloud database. However, no method of transmission is 100% secure.

## 5. International Transfers
If you use our Cloud Sync features, your data may be transferred to and processed in servers located outside your country of residence (e.g., Supabase servers). By using the Cloud Sync feature, you consent to this transfer. We bear no liability for data sovereignty issues arising from international cloud storage.

## 6. Your Rights (UK GDPR)
Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), you have the right to:

**The Software is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any representation, warranty, or condition of any kind.**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we expressly disclaim all warranties, including:
-   Merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
-   That the Software will be error-free or uninterrupted.
-   **Safety Warning**: The Software is a record-keeping tool, **not a safety-critical system**. We accept no liability for equipment failure or injury resulting from reliance on data in this Software.

1.  **Indirect Loss**: We are not liable for loss of profits, data, use, or goodwill.
