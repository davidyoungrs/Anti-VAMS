# Commercialisation Models

## Model 1: The "Asset Sovereignty" Model (End User Purchased)

In this model, the Asset Owner (Power Station, Refinery) purchases the software to ensure they control their data regardless of which contractor is on site.

*   **Who Pays:** The Asset Owner (End User).
*   **Pricing Benchmark:** £10k–£25k / year (Small–Mid deployment).
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The Asset Owner buys the core SaaS subscription for their site / operations.
    *   They grant **"Guest/Contractor" access** to their valve service companies during outages or maintenance rounds.
    *   Contractors use the system to manage workload, upload inspection reports, test results and valve histories directly into the owner's environment.
*   **Why pay for this (The Pitch):**
    *   **Continuity:** The owner retains the "lived history" of the valves even if they change service contractors.
    *   **Cost Avoidance:** The owner justifies the spend through "avoided outage extensions" (valued at ~£40k/year) and risk reduction.
    *   **Control:** It prevents contractors from holding data ransom or keeping it in "shadow systems".

## Model 2: The "Tech-Enabled Service" Model (Service Company Purchased)

In this model, the Valve Service Company purchases the software to professionalize their reporting and differentiate themselves from "body shop" competitors.

*   **Who Pays:** The Independent Valve Service Company.
*   **Pricing Benchmark:** £3k–£8k / year.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The Service Company buys a commercial license to manage *all* their different client contracts within one system.
    *   They give their End User customers "Client Portal" access (read-only or restricted view) to see the status of their specific assets.
    *   The Service Company delivers the final "Digital Valve Dossier" via the app rather than emailing PDFs.
*   **Why pay for this (The Pitch):**
    *   **Stickiness:** It makes it harder for the customer to change from them, as the customer relies on the service company's portal for data.
    *   **Efficiency:** It reduces unbillable technician time spent chasing old reports.
    *   **Secondary for the owners:**
        *   **Valuation Uplift:** It transforms the service firm from a labor-provider into a "technical platform," potentially increasing their EBITDA valuation multiple by 1.25x upon exit.
